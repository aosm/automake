The effect of `--cygnus'
************************

   Some packages, notably GNU GCC and GNU gdb, have a build environment
originally written at Cygnus Support (subsequently renamed Cygnus
Solutions, and then later purchased by Red Hat).  Packages with this
ancestry are sometimes referred to as "Cygnus" trees.

   A Cygnus tree has slightly different rules for how a `Makefile.in'
is to be constructed.  Passing `--cygnus' to `automake' will cause any
generated `Makefile.in' to comply with Cygnus rules.

   Here are the precise effects of `--cygnus':

   * Info files are always created in the build directory, and not in
     the source directory.

   * `texinfo.tex' is not required if a Texinfo source file is
     specified.  The assumption is that the file will be supplied, but
     in a place that Automake cannot find.  This assumption is an
     artifact of how Cygnus packages are typically bundled.

   * `make dist' is not supported, and the rules for it are not
     generated.  Cygnus-style trees use their own distribution
     mechanism.

   * Certain tools will be searched for in the build tree as well as in
     the user's `PATH'.  These tools are `runtest', `expect',
     `makeinfo' and `texi2dvi'.

   * `--foreign' is implied.

   * The options `no-installinfo' and `no-dependencies' are implied.

   * The macros `AM_MAINTAINER_MODE' and `AM_CYGWIN32' are required.

   * The `check' target doesn't depend on `all'.

   GNU maintainers are advised to use `gnu' strictness in preference to
the special Cygnus mode.  Some day, perhaps, the differences between
Cygnus trees and GNU trees will disappear (for instance, as GCC is made
more standards compliant).  At that time the special Cygnus mode will be
removed.

When Automake Isn't Enough
**************************

   Automake's implicit copying semantics means that many problems can be
worked around by simply adding some `make' targets and rules to
`Makefile.in'.  Automake will ignore these additions.

   There are some caveats to doing this.  Although you can overload a
target already used by Automake, it is often inadvisable, particularly
in the topmost directory of a package with subdirectories.  However,
various useful targets have a `-local' version you can specify in your
`Makefile.in'.  Automake will supplement the standard target with these
user-supplied targets.

   The targets that support a local version are `all', `info', `dvi',
`check', `install-data', `install-exec', `uninstall', `installdirs',
`installcheck' and the various `clean' targets (`mostlyclean', `clean',
`distclean', and `maintainer-clean').  Note that there are no
`uninstall-exec-local' or `uninstall-data-local' targets; just use
`uninstall-local'.  It doesn't make sense to uninstall just data or
just executables.

   For instance, here is one way to install a file in `/etc':

     install-data-local:
             $(INSTALL_DATA) $(srcdir)/afile $(DESTDIR)/etc/afile

   Some targets also have a way to run another target, called a "hook",
after their work is done.  The hook is named after the principal target,
with `-hook' appended.  The targets allowing hooks are `install-data',
`install-exec', `uninstall', `dist', and `distcheck'.

   For instance, here is how to create a hard link to an installed
program:

     install-exec-hook:
             ln $(DESTDIR)$(bindir)/program $(DESTDIR)$(bindir)/proglink

Distributing `Makefile.in's
***************************

   Automake places no restrictions on the distribution of the resulting
`Makefile.in's.  We still encourage software authors to distribute
their work under terms like those of the GPL, but doing so is not
required to use Automake.

   Some of the files that can be automatically installed via the
`--add-missing' switch do fall under the GPL.  However, these also have
a special exception allowing you to distribute them with your package,
regardless of the licensing you choose.

Automake API versioning
***********************

   New Automake releases usually include bug fixes and new features.
Unfortunately they may also introduce new bugs and incompatibilities.
This makes four reasons why a package may require a particular Automake
version.

   Things get worse when maintaining a large tree of packages, each one
requiring a different version of Automake.  In the past, this meant that
any developer (and sometime users) had to install several versions of
Automake in different places, and switch `$PATH' appropriately for each
package.

   Starting with version 1.6, Automake installs versioned binaries.
This means you can install several versions of Automake in the same
`$prefix', and can select an arbitrary Automake version by running
`automake-1.6' or `automake-1.7' without juggling with `$PATH'.
Furthermore, `Makefile''s generated by Automake 1.6 will use
`automake-1.6' explicitely in their rebuild rules.

   Note that `1.6' in `automake-1.6' is Automake's API version, not
Automake's version.  If a bug fix release is made, for instance
Automake 1.6.1, the API version will remain 1.6.  This means that a
package which work with Automake 1.6 should also work with 1.6.1; after
all, this is what people expect from bug fix releases.

   Note that if your package relies on a feature or a bug fix
introduced in a release, you can pass this version as an option to
Automake to ensure older releases will not be used.  For instance, use
this in your `configure.in':

       AM_INIT_AUTOMAKE(1.6.1)    dnl Require Automake 1.6.1 or better.

or, in a particular `Makefile.am':

       AUTOMAKE_OPTIONS = 1.6.1   # Require Automake 1.6.1 or better.

Automake will print an error message if its version is older than the
requested version.

What is in the API
==================

   Automake's programing interface is not easy to define.  Basically it
should include at least all *documented* variables and targets that a
`Makefile.am' authors can use, the behaviours associated to them (e.g.
the places where `-hook''s are run), the command line interface of
`automake' and `aclocal', ...

What is not in the API
======================

   Every undocumented variable, target, or command line option, is not
part of the API.  You should avoid using them, as they could change
from one version to the other (even in bug fix releases, if this helps
to fix a bug).

   If it turns out you need to use such a undocumented feature, contact
<automake@gnu.org> and try to get it documented and exercised by the
test-suite.
